1. Project Overview
This website is a music streaming web application developed using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript. The main focus of the project is to build a complete music player from scratch without using any frameworks. The project is currently under active development and is not yet finalized, but its core functionality is stable and usable.

2. Music Playback System
The strongest part of the website is its working music playback system. Songs play smoothly using the JavaScript Audio API, and basic controls like play, pause, next, and previous are functioning correctly. The logic is handled through JavaScript, making the player dynamic rather than static.

3. Popular Songs Section
The Popular Songs section is fully functional and correctly linked with the music player. Users can select songs directly from this section, and the selected song plays without issues. This part clearly shows proper DOM manipulation and event handling.

4. UI and CSS Design
The CSS is well-structured and visually clean, giving the website a modern look. The layout is stable, and special care has been taken in future to make the design responsive.

5. Current Limitations
Some features like search functionality, artist management, and advanced playlists are not fully working or are still being redesigned. These limitations are acknowledged and are part of the ongoing development process.

6. Development Goal
The goal of this project is to convert it into a professional-grade music web application by improving UX, fixing edge cases, optimizing code, and adding missing features — all while strengthening core frontend skills.
